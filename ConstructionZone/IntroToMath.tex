Before you get started, make sure you have read Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}, which sets the tone for the work we will begin doing here. In addition, you might find is useful to read Appendix~\ref{appendix:elements_of_style}: Elements of Style for Proofs. As stated at the end of Section~\ref{sec:minimal guidance}, you are encouraged to review this appendix occasionally as you progress through the book as some guidelines may not initially make sense or seem relevant.
