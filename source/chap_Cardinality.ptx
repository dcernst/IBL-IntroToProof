      \epigraph{I counted everything.
      I counted the steps to the road, the steps up to church,
      the number of dishes and silverware I washed <ellipsis/> anything that could be counted, I did.}{Katherine Johnson,
      mathematician}

      In this chapter, we will explore the notion of cardinality,
      which formalizes what it means for two sets to be the same
      <q>size</q>.
