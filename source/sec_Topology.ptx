  <title>Standard Topology of the Real Line</title>
  <p>
    In this section,
    we will introduce the notions of open, closed, compact,
    and connected as they pertain to subsets of the real numbers.
    These properties form the underpinnings of a branch of mathematics called <em>topology</em>
    (derived from the Greek words <em>t&#xf3;pos</em>, meaning <sq>place,
    location</sq>, and <em>ology</em>,
    meaning <sq>study of</sq>).
    Topology, sometimes called
    <q>rubber sheet geometry,</q>
    is concerned with properties of spaces that are invariant under any continuous deformation (e.g., bending,
    twisting,
    and stretching like rubber while not allowing tearing apart or gluing together).
    The fundamental concepts in topology are continuity,
    compactness, and connectedness,
    which rely on ideas such as
    <q>arbitrary close</q>
    and
    <q>far apart</q>. These ideas can be made precise using open sets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once considered an abstract branch of pure mathematics,
    topology now has applications in biology,
    computer science, physics, and robotics.
    The goal of this section is to introduce you to the basics of the set-theoretic definitions used in topology and to provide you with an opportunity to tinker with open and closed subsets of the real numbers.
    In <xref ref="sec_Continuity">Section</xref>,
    we will revisit these concepts and explore continuous functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this entire section,
    our universe of discourse is the set of real numbers.
    You may assume all the usual basic algebraic properties of the real numbers
    (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
    division, commutative property, distribution, etc.).
    We will often refer to an element in a subset of real numbers as a <em>point</em>.

        A set <m>U</m> is called an open set if for every <m>x \in U</m>,
        there exists a bounded open interval <m>(a,b)</m> containing <m>x</m> such that <m>(a,b)\subseteq U</m>.

    It follows immediately from the definition that every open set is a union of bounded open intervals.

    every open interval (i.e., intervals of the form <m>(a,b)</m>,

    It is important to point out that there is a more general definition of compact in an arbitrary topological space.

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Is every finite set compact?
        Justify your assertion.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>
  <p>
    The next theorem says that every nonempty compact set contains its greatest lower bound and its least upper bound.
    That is, every nonempty compact set attains a minimum and a maximum value.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>K</m> is a nonempty compact subset of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
        then <m>\sup(K),\inf(K)\in K</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A set <m>A\subseteq \mathbb{R}</m> is disconnected if there exists two disjoint open sets <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> such that <m>A\cap U_1</m> and
        <m>A\cap U_2</m> are nonempty but <m>A\subseteq U_1\cup U_2</m> (equivalently,
        <m>A=(A\cap U_1)\cup(A\cap U_2)</m>).
        If a set is not disconnected,
        then we say that it is connected.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    In other words,
    a set is disconnected if it can be partitioned into two nonempty subsets such that each subset does not contain points of the other and does not contain any accumulation points of the other.
    Showing that a set is disconnected is generally easier than showing a set is connected.
    To prove that a set is disconnected,
    you simply need to exhibit two open sets with the necessary properties.
    However, to prove that a set is connected,
    you need to prove that no such pair of open sets exists.
  </p>
  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine whether each of the sets in <xref ref="prob_compact_or_not">Problem</xref>
        is is connected or disconnected.
        Briefly justify your assertions.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>a\in\mathbb{R}</m>, then <m>\{a\}</m> is connected.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The proof of the next theorem is harder than you might expect.
    Consider a proof by contradiction and try to make use of the Completeness Axiom.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_closed_interval_connected">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> is connected.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    It turns out that every connected set in
    <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is either a singleton or an interval.
    We have not officially proved this claim,
    but we do have the tools to do so.
    Feel free to try your hand at proving this fact.
