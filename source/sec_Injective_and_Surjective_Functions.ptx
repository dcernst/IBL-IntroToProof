  <title>Injective and Surjective Functions</title>
  <p>
    We now turn our attention to some important properties that a function may or may not possess.
    Recall that if <m>f</m> is a function,
    then every element in its domain is mapped to a unique element in the range.
    However, there are no restrictions on whether more than one element of the domain is mapped to the same element in the range.
    If each element in the range has a unique element in the domain mapping to it,
    then we say that the function is injective.
    Moreover, the range of a function is not required to be all of the codomain.
    If every element of the codomain has at least one element in the domain that maps to it,
    then we say that the function is surjective.
    Let's make these definitions a bit more precise.

    How do we prove that a function <m>f</m> is injective?
    We would need to show that every element in the range has a unique element from the domain that maps to it.
    First, notice that each element in the range can be written as <m>f(x)</m> for at least one <m>x</m> in the domain.
    To argue that each such element in domain is unique,
    we can suppose <m>f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})</m> for arbitrary <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> in the domain and then work to show that <m>x_{1}=x_{2}</m>.
    It is important to point out that when we suppose
    <m>f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})</m> for some <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>,
    we are not assuming that <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are different.
    In general, when we write
    <q>Let <m>x_1,x_2\in X</m><ellipsis/></q>, we are leaving open the possibility that <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are actually the same element.
    One could approach proving that a function is injective by utilizing a proof by contradiction,
    but this is not usually necessary.

    How do we prove that a function <m>f</m> is surjective?
    We would need to argue that every element in the codomain is also in the range.
    Sometimes, the proof that a particular function is surjective is extremely short,
    so do not second guess yourself if you find yourself in this situation.

    If <m>f</m> is a function,
    the equivalence relation in <xref ref="thm_equiv_relation_from_preimages">Theorem</xref>
    allows us to construct a bijective function whose domain is the set of equivalence classes and whose codomain coincides with the range of <m>f</m>.
    This is an important idea that manifests itself in many areas of mathematics.
    One such instance is the First Isomorphism Theorem for Groups,
    which is a fundamental theorem in a branch of mathematics called group theory.
    When proving the following theorem,
    the first thing you should do is verify that the description for <m>\overline{f}</m> is well defined.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_iso_theorem_for_sets">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f:X\to Y</m> be a function and define <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m> as in <xref ref="thm_equiv_relation_from_preimages">Theorem</xref>.
        Then the function <m>\overline{f}:X/\mathord\sim\to \range(f)</m> defined via <m>\overline{f}([a]) = f(a)</m> is a bijection.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    Here is an analogy for helping understand the content of <xref ref="thm_iso_theorem_for_sets">Theorem</xref>.
    Suppose we have a collection airplanes filled with passengers and a collection of potential destination cities such that at most one airplane may land at each city.
    The function <m>f</m> indicates which city each passenger lands at while the function
    <m>\overline{f}</m> indicates which city each airplane lands at.
    Moreover, the codomain for the function
    <m>\overline{f}</m> consists only of the cities that an airplane lands at.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X=\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}</m> and
        <m>Y=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> and define <m>\varphi:X\to Y</m> via
        <me>
          \varphi=\{(a,1),(b,1),(c,2),(d,4),(e,4),(f,4)\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function diagram for <m>\varphi</m> is given in <xref ref="fig_passengers_and_airplanes">Figure</xref>\subref{fig:passengers}, where we have highlighted the elements of the domain that map to the same element in the range by enclosing them in additional boxes.
        We see that <m>\range(\varphi)=\{1,2,4\}</m>.
        The function diagram for the induced map
        <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> that is depicted in <xref ref="fig_passengers_and_airplanes">Figure</xref>\subref{fig:airplanes} makes it clear that <m>\overline{\varphi}</m> is a bijection.
        Note that since <m>\varphi(a)=\varphi(b)</m> and <m>\varphi(d)=\varphi(e)=\varphi(f)</m>,
        it must be the case that <m>[a]=[b]</m> and
        <m>[d]=[e]=[f]</m> according to <xref ref="thm_related_if_and_only_if_same_class">Theorem</xref>.
        Thus, the vertices labeled as <m>[a]</m> and <m>[d]</m> in <xref ref="fig_passengers_and_airplanes">Figure</xref>\subref{fig:airplanes} could have also been labeled as <m>[b]</m> and <m>[c]</m> or <m>[d]</m>,
        respectively.
        In terms of our passengers and airplanes analogy,
        <m>X=\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}</m> is the set of passengers,
        <m>Y=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> is the set of potential destination cities,
        <m>X/\mathord\sim=\{[a],[c],[d]\}</m> is the set of airplanes,
        and <m>\range(\varphi)=\{1,2,4\}</m> is the set of cities that airplanes land at.
        The equivalence class <m>[a]</m> is the airplane containing the passenger <m>a</m>,
        and since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are on the same plane,
        <m>[b]</m> is also the plane containing the passenger <m>a</m>.

    The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,

    but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
    who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions;
    who spends himself in a worthy cause;
    who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
