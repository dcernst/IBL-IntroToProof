      \epigraph{Every time that a human being succeeds in making an effort of attention with the sole idea of increasing [their] grasp of truth, [they acquire] a greater aptitude for grasping it,
      even if [their] effort produces no visible fruit.}{Simone Weil,
      philosopher &amp; political activist}

      In this chapter, we introduce mathematical induction,
      which is a proof technique that is useful for proving statements of the form <m>(\forall n \in \mathbb{N})P(n)</m>,
      or more generally <m>(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z})(n\geq a\implies P(n))</m>,
      where <m>P(n)</m> is some predicate and <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
