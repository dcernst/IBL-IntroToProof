  <title>Introduction to Quantification</title>
  <p>
    In this section and the next,
    we introduce <em>first-order logic</em><mdash/>also referred to as
    <em>predicate logic</em>,
    <em>quantificational logic</em>,
    and <em>first-order predicate calculus</em>.
    The sentence
    <q><m>x>0</m></q>
    is not itself a proposition because its truth value depends on <m>x</m>.
    In this case, we say that <m>x</m> is a <em>free variable</em>.
    A sentence with at least one free variable is called a <em>predicate</em>
    (or <em>open sentence</em>).
    To turn a predicate into a proposition,
    we must either substitute values for each free variable or
    <q>quantify</q>
    the free variables.
    We will use notation such as <m>\tcboxmath{P(x)}</m> and
    <m>\tcboxmath{Q(a,b)}</m> to represent predicates with free variables <m>x</m> and <m>a,b</m>,
    respectively.
    The letters
    <q><m>P</m></q>
    and
    <q><m>Q</m></q>
    that we used in the previous sentence are not special;
    we can use any letter or symbol we want.
    For example,
    each of the following represents a predicate with the indicated free variables.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>S(x)\coloneqq \text{ `` } x^2-4=0\text{ '' }</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>L(a,b)\coloneqq \text{ `` } a\lt b\text{ '' }</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>F(x,y)\coloneqq \text{ `` } x \mbox{ is friends with } y\text{ '' }</m>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that we used quotation marks above to remove some ambiguity.
    What would <m>S(x)=x^2-4=0</m> mean?
    It looks like <m>S(x)</m> equals 0, but actually we want <m>S(x)</m> to represent the whole sentence
    <q><m>x^2-4=0</m></q>. Also, notice that the order in which we utilize the free variables might matter.
    For example, compare <m>L(a,b)</m> with <m>L(b,a)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    One way we can make propositions out of predicates is by assigning specific values to the free variables.
    That is, if <m>P(x)</m> is a predicate and <m>x_0</m> is specific value for <m>x</m>,
    then <m>P(x_0)</m> is now a proposition that is either true or false.
  </p>
  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider <m>S(x)</m> and <m>L(a,b)</m> as defined above.
        Determine the truth values of <m>S(0)</m>, <m>S(-2)</m>,
        <m>L(2,1)</m>, and <m>L(-3,-2)</m>.
        Is <m>L(2,b)</m> a proposition or a predicate?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>
  <p>
    Besides substituting specific values for free variables in a predicate,
    we can also make a claim about which values of the free variables apply to the predicate.

  </definition>
  <p>
    In mathematics, the phrases
    <q>for all</q>,
    <q>for any</q>,
    <q>for every</q>, and
    <q>for each</q>
    can be used interchangeably
    (even though they might convey slightly different meanings in colloquial language).
    We can replace
    <q>there exists<ellipsis/> such that</q>
    with phrases like
    <q>for some</q>
    (possibly with some tweaking of the wording of the sentence).
    It is important to note that the existential quantifier is making a claim about
    <q>at least one</q>, <em>not</em>
    <q>exactly one.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Variables that are quantified with a universal or existential quantifier are said to be <em>bound</em>.
    To be a proposition, <em>all</em>
    variables of a predicate must be bound.
  </p>
  <p>
    We must take care to specify the collection of acceptable values for the free variables.
    Consider the sentence
    <q>For all <m>x</m>, <m>x>0</m>.</q>
    Is this sentence true or false?
    The answer depends on what set the universal quantifier applies to.
    Certainly, the sentence is false if we apply it for all <m>x\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
    However, the sentence is true for all <m>x\in\mathbb{N}</m>.
    Context may resolve ambiguities,
    but otherwise, we must write clearly:
    <q>For all <m>x\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>x>0</m></q>
    or
    <q>For all <m>x\in\mathbb{N}</m>, <m>x>0</m>.</q>
    The collection of intended values for a variable is called the
    <em>universe of discourse</em>.

    If a predicate has more than one free variable,
    then we can build propositions by quantifying each variable.
    However, <em>the order of the quantifiers is extremely important!</em>

  <p>
    There are a couple of key points to keep in mind about quantification.
    To be a proposition, all variables must be quantified.
    This can happen in at least two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The variables are explicitly bound by quantifiers in the same sentence.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The variables are implicitly bound by preceding sentences or by context.
          Statements of the form
          <q>Let <m>x=\ldots</m></q>
          and
          <q>Assume <m>x\in\ldots</m></q>
          bind the variable <m>x</m> and remove ambiguity.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, the order of the quantification is important.
    Reversing the order of the quantifiers can substantially change the meaning of a proposition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quantification and logical connectives (
    <q>and,</q>
    <q>or,</q>
    <q>If<ellipsis/>, then<ellipsis/>,</q>
    and
    <q>not</q>
    ) enable complex mathematical statements.
    For example,
    if <m>f</m> is a function while <m>c</m> and <m>L</m> are real numbers,
    then the formal definition of <m>\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=L</m>,
    which you may have encountered in calculus, is:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    For all <m>\varepsilon >0</m>, there exists <m>\delta >0</m> such that for all <m>x</m>, if <m>0\lt |x-c|\lt \delta</m>, then <m>|f(x)-L|\lt \varepsilon</m>.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    In order to study the abstract nature of complicated mathematical statements,
    it is useful to adopt some notation.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_quantifiers">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The universal quantifier
        <q>for all</q>
        is denoted <m>\tcboxmath{\forall}</m>,
        and the existential quantifier
        <q>there exists<ellipsis/> such that</q>
        is denoted <m>\tcboxmath{\exists}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Using our abbreviations for the logical connectives and quantifiers,
    we can symbolically represent mathematical propositions.
    For example, the (true) proposition
    <q>There exists <m>x \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>x^2-1=0</m></q>
    becomes
    <q><m>(\exists x \in \mathbb{R})(x^2-1=0)</m>,</q>
    while the (false) proposition
    <q>For all <m>x\in \mathbb{N}</m>,
    there exists <m>y\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>y\lt x</m></q>
    becomes

  </problem>
  <p>
    If you look closely,
    many of the theorems that we have encountered up until this point were of the form <m>A(x)\implies B(x)</m>,
    where <m>A(x)</m> and <m>B(x)</m> are predicates.
    For example,
    consider <xref ref="thm_n_even_implies_n_2_even">Theorem</xref>,
    which states, ``If <m>n</m> is an even integer,
    then <m>n^2</m> is an even integer." In this case,
    <q><m>n</m> is an even integer</q>
    and
    <q><m>n^2</m> is an even integer</q>
    are both predicates.
    So, it would be reasonable to assume that the entire theorem statement is a predicate.
    However, it is standard practice to interpret the sentence
    <m>A(x)\implies B(x)</m> to mean <m>(\forall x)(A(x)\implies B(x))</m>
    (where the universe of discourse for <m>x</m> needs to be made clear).
    We can also retool such statements to
    <q>hide</q>
    the implication.
    In particular,
    <m>(\forall x)(A(x)\implies B(x))</m> has the same meaning as <m>(\forall x \in U')B(x)</m>,
    where <m>U'</m> is the collection of items from the universe of discourse <m>U</m> that makes <m>A(x)</m> true.
    For example,
    we could rewrite the statement of <xref ref="thm_n_even_implies_n_2_even">Theorem</xref> as
    <q>For every even integer <m>n</m>, <m>n^2</m> is even.</q>
