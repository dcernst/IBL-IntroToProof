  <title>More on Induction</title>
  <p>
    In the previous section,
    we discussed proving statements of the form <m>(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}) P(n)</m>.
    Mathematical induction can actually be used to prove a broader family of results;
    namely, those of the form <m>(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z})(n \geq a \implies P(n))</m> for any value <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
    <xref ref="thm_PMI">Theorem</xref>
    handles the special case when <m>a = 1</m>.
    The ladder analogy from the previous section holds for this more general situation, too.
    To prove the next theorem,
    mimic the proof of <xref ref="thm_PMI">Theorem</xref>,
    but this time use the set <m>S=\{k\in \mathbb{N}\mid P(a+k-1) \text{ is true } \}</m>.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_PMI2">
    <title>Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), \ldots</m> be a sequence of statements,
        one for each integer greater than or equal to <m>a</m>.
        Assume that
        <ol marker="labeltextrmroman">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>P(a)</m> is true, and

          <li>
            <p>
              for all <m>k\geq a</m>, if <m>P(k)</m> is true,

            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

    gives a process for proving statements of the form:
    <q>For all integers <m>n\geq a</m>, <m>P(n)</m>.</q>
    As before, hypothesis (i) is called the <em>base step</em>,
    and (ii) is called the <em>inductive step</em>.

    <title>Skeleton Proof</title>
    <p>
      [Proof of <m>(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z})(n \geq a \implies P(n))</m> by Induction] Here is the general structure for a proof by induction when the base case does not necessarily involve <m>a=1</m>.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We proceed by induction.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>(i)</title>
            <p>
              Base step: <em>[Verify that <m>P(a)</m> is true.
              This often, but not always,
              amounts to plugging <m>n=a</m> into two sides of some claimed equation and <em>verifying</em>
              that both sides are actually equal.]</em>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>(ii)</title>
            <p>
              Inductive step: <em>[Your goal is to prove
              <q>For all <m>k\geq a</m>,
              if <m>P(k)</m> is true, then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.</q>
              ]</em> Let <m>k \geq a</m> be an integer and assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
              <em>[Do something to derive that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.]</em>
              Therefore, <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, by induction,
        <m>P(n)</m> is true for all integers <m>n \ge a</m>.

    We encountered the next theorem back in <xref ref="sec_PowerSets">Section</xref>
    (see <xref ref="conjecture_PowerSets">Conjecture</xref>),
    but we did not prove it.
    When proving this theorem using induction,
    you will need to argue that if you add one more element to a finite set,
    then you end up with twice as many subsets.
    For your base case, consider the empty set.

    We now consider an induction problem of a different sort,

        Suppose <m>n</m> lines are drawn in the plane so that no two lines are parallel and no three lines intersect at any one point.
        Such a collection of lines is said to be in
        <em>general position</em>.
        Every collection of lines in general position divides the plane into disjoint regions,
        some of which are polygons with finite area
        (bounded regions)
        and some of which are not
        (unbounded regions).
