    imply that if <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on a set <m>A</m>,
    then <m>\sim</m> breaks <m>A</m> up into pairwise disjoint
    <q>chunks</q>, where each chunk is some <m>[a]</m> for <m>a\in A</m>.
    As you have probably already noticed,
    equivalence relations are intimately related to the following concept.

        A collection <m>\Omega</m> of subsets of a set <m>A</m> is said to be a partition of <m>A</m> if the elements of <m>\Omega</m> satisfy:
        <ol marker="labeltextrmalph">
          <li>
            <p>

        Consider the equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on the set <m>P</m> described in <xref ref="ex_last_name">Example</xref>.
        Recall that the equivalence classes correspond to collections of individuals with the same last name.
        Since each equivalence class is nonempty and each resident of the town belongs to exactly one equivalence class,
        the collection of equivalence classes forms a partition of <m>P</m>.
        That is, <m>P/\mathord\sim</m> is a partition of <m>P</m>,

    It turns out that we can reverse the situation, as well.
    That is, given a partition,
    we can form an equivalence relation such that the equivalence classes correspond to the blocks of the partition.
    Before proving this, we need a definition.

    Recall that <xref ref="thm_equiv_yields_partition2">Theorem</xref>
    says that the equivalence classes for a relation on a nonempty set <m>A</m> determines a partition of <m>A</m>.
    The following theorem tells us that every partition of a set yields an equivalence relation where the equivalence classes correspond to the blocks of the partition.
    This result is a consequence of <xref ref="thm_union_yields_reflexive">Theorems</xref>,
