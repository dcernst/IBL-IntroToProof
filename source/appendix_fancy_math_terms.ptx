  <title>Fancy Mathematical Terms</title>
  <p>
    Here are some important mathematical terms that you will encounter throughout mathematics.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Definition</term><mdash/>a precise and unambiguous description of the meaning of a mathematical term.
          It characterizes the meaning of a word by giving all the properties and only those properties that must be true.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Theorem</term><mdash/>a mathematical statement that is proved using rigorous mathematical reasoning.
          In a mathematical paper,
          the term theorem is often reserved for the most important results.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Proposition</term><mdash/>a proved and often interesting result,
          but generally less important than a theorem. Alternatively, a <term>proposition</term> may refer to a sentence that is either true or false but never both (see <xref ref="def_proposition">Definition</xref>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Lemma</term><mdash/>a minor result whose sole purpose is to help in proving a theorem.
          It is a stepping stone on the path to proving a theorem.
          Occasionally lemmas can take on a life of their own (Zorn's Lemma, Urysohn's Lemma, Burnside's Lemma, Sperner's Lemma).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Corollary</term><mdash/>a result in which the
          (usually short)
          proof relies heavily on a given theorem
          (we often say that
          <q>this is a corollary of Theorem A</q>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Conjecture</term><mdash/>a statement that is unproved,
          but is believed to be true (Collatz Conjecture, Goldbach Conjecture, Twin prime Conjecture).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Claim</term><mdash/>an assertion that is then proved.
          It is often used like an informal lemma.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Counterexample</term><mdash/>a specific example showing that a statement is false.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Axiom/Postulate</term><mdash/>a statement that is assumed to be true without proof.
          These are the basic building blocks from which all theorems are proved (Euclid's five postulates,
          axioms of ZFC, Peano axioms).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Identity</term><mdash/>a mathematical expression giving the equality of two
          (often variable)
          quantities
          (trigonometric identities, Euler's identity).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Paradox</term><mdash/>a statement that can be shown,
          using a given set of axioms and definitions,
          to be both true and false.
          Paradoxes are often used to show the inconsistencies in a flawed axiomatic theory (e.g., Russell's Paradox).
          The term paradox is also used informally to describe a surprising or counterintuitive result that follows from a given set of rules (Banach-Tarski Paradox, Alabama Paradox, Gabriel's Horn).
