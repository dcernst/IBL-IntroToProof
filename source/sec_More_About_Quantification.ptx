  <p>
    When writing mathematical proofs,
    we do not explicitly use the symbolic representation of a given statement in terms of quantifiers and logical connectives.
    Nonetheless,
    having this notation at our disposal allows us to compartmentalize the abstract nature of mathematical propositions and provides us with a way to talk about the general structure involved in the construction of a proof.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Two quantified propositions are <term>logically equivalent</term> if they have the same truth value in every universe of discourse.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the propositions <m>(\exists x\in U)(x^2-4=0)</m> and <m>(\exists x\in U)(x^2-2=0)</m>,
        where <m>U</m> is some universe of discourse.
        <ol marker="labeltextrmalph">
          <li>
            <p>
              Do these propositions have the same truth value if the universe of discourse is the set of real numbers?

          <li>
            <p>
              Provide an example of a universe of discourse such that the propositions yield different truth values.

            <p>
              What can you conclude about the logical equivalence of these propositions?

    It is worth pointing out an important distinction.
    Consider the propositions
    <q>All cars are red</q>
    and
    <q>All natural numbers are positive</q>. Both of these are instances of the
    <term>logical form</term> <m>(\forall x)P(x)</m>.
    It turns out that the first proposition is false and the second is true;
    however, it does not make sense to attach a truth value to the logical form.
    A logical form is a blueprint for particular propositions.
    If we are careful,
    it makes sense to talk about whether two logical forms are logically equivalent.
    For example,
    <m>(\forall x)(P(x)\implies Q(x))</m> is logically equivalent to
    <m>(\forall x)(\neg Q(x)\implies \neg P(x))</m> since a conditional proposition is logically equivalent to its contrapositive
    (see <xref ref="thm_contrapos">Theorem</xref>).
    For fixed <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m>,
    these two forms will always have the same truth value independent of the universe of discourse.
    If you change <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m>,
    then the truth value may change,
    but the two forms will still agree.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next theorem tells us how to negate logical forms involving quantifiers.
    Your proof should involve several mini arguments.
    For example, in Part<nbsp/>(a),
    you will need to proof that if <m>\neg (\forall x)P(x)</m> is true,
    then <m>(\exists x)(\neg P(x))</m> is also true.

  <p>
    Using <xref ref="thm_negation_of_quantifiers">Theorem</xref>
    and our previous results involving quantification,
    we can negate complex mathematical propositions by working from left to right.
    For example, if we negate the false proposition
    <me>
      (\exists x\in\mathbb{R})(\forall y\in\mathbb{R})(x+y=0)
    </me>,
    we obtain the proposition
    <me>
      \neg(\exists x\in\mathbb{R})(\forall y\in\mathbb{R})(x+y=0)
    </me>,
    which is logically equivalent to
    <me>
      (\forall x\in\mathbb{R})(\exists y\in\mathbb{R})(x+y\neq 0)
    </me>
    and must be true.
    For a more complicated example,
    consider the (false) proposition
    <me>
      (\forall x)[x>0\implies (\exists y)(y\lt 0 \wedge xy>0)]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then its negation
    <me>
      \neg (\forall x)[x>0\implies (\exists y)(y\lt 0 \wedge xy>0)]
    </me>
    is logically equivalent to
    <me>
      (\exists x)[x>0 \wedge \neg (\exists y)(y\lt 0 \wedge xy>0)]
    </me>,
    which happens to be logically equivalent to
    <me>
      (\exists x)[x>0 \wedge (\forall y)(y\geq 0 \vee xy\leq 0)]
    </me>.

    Can you identify the theorems that were used in the two examples above?

<p>Sometimes it is useful to split the universe of discourse into multiple collections to deal with separately. When doing this, it is important to make sure that your cases are exhaustive (i.e., every possible element of the universe of discourse has been accounted for). Ideally, your cases will also be disjoint (i.e., you have not considered the same element more than once). For example, if our universe of discourse is the set of integers, we can separately consider even versus odd integers. If our universe of discourse is the set of real numbers, we might want to consider rational versus irrational numbers, or possibly negative versus zero versus and positive. Attacking a proof in this way, is often referred to as a <term>proof by cases</term> (or <term>proof by exhaustion</term>). A proof by cases may also be useful when dealing with hypotheses involving <q>or</q>. Note that the use of a proof by cases is justified by <xref ref="thm_logical_form_for_cases">Theorem</xref>.</p>

  <p>
    If you decide to approach a proof using cases,
    be sure to inform the reader that you are doing so and organize your proof in a sensible way.
    Note that doing an analysis of cases should be avoided if possible.
    For example,
    while it is valid to separately consider the cases of whether <m>a</m> is an even integer versus odd integer in the proof of <xref ref="thm_divides_sum">Theorem</xref>,
    it is completely unnecessary.
    To prove the next theorem, you might want to consider two cases.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_3n_2_n_14_is_even">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For all <m>n\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>3n^2+n+14</m> is even.

    Prove the following theorem by proving the contrapositive using two cases.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_nm_odd_implies_n_or_m_odd">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For all <m>n,m\in\mathbb{Z}</m>,
        if <m>nm</m> is odd, then <m>n</m> is odd and <m>m</m> is odd.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    When proving the previous theorem,
    you likely experienced some d&#xe8;j&#xe1; vu.
    You should have assumed
    <q><m>n</m> is even or <m>m</m> is even</q>
    at some point in your proof.
    The first case is
    <q><m>n</m> is even</q>
    while the second case is
    <q><m>m</m> is even.</q>
    (Note that you do not need to handle the case when both <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> are even since the two individual cases already yield the desired result.) The proofs for both cases are identical except the roles of <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> are interchanged.
    In instances such as this, mathematicians have a shortcut.
    Instead of writing two essentially identical proofs for each case,
    you can simply handle one of the cases and indicate that the remaining case follows from a nearly identical proof.
    The quickest way to do this is to use the phrase,
    <q>Without loss of generality, assume<ellipsis/></q>. For example,
    here is a proof of <xref ref="thm_nm_odd_implies_n_or_m_odd">Theorem</xref> that utilizes this approach.
  </p>

<proof>
<title>Proof of <xref ref="thm_nm_odd_implies_n_or_m_odd">Theorem</xref></title>
<p>We will prove the contrapositive. Let <m>n,m\in\mathbb{Z}</m> and assume <m>n</m> is even or <m>m</m> is even. Without loss of generality, assume <m>n</m> is even. Then there exists <m>k\in\mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>n=2k</m>. We see that
<me>
nm=(2k)m=2(km)
</me>.
</p>

<p>Since both <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> are integers, <m>km</m> is an integer. This shows that <m>nm</m> is even. We have proved the contrapositive, and hence for all <m>n,m\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, if <m>nm</m> is odd, then <m>n</m> is odd and <m>m</m> is odd.
</p>
</proof>

  <p>
    Note that it would not be appropriate to utilize the
    <q>without loss of generality</q>
    approach to combine the two cases in the proof of <xref ref="thm_3n_2_n_14_is_even">Theorem</xref>
    since the proof of the second case is not as simple as swapping the roles of symbols in the proof of the first case.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are times when a theorem will make a claim about the <em>uniqueness</em>
    of a particular mathematical object.
    For example,
    in <xref ref="sec_AxiomsRealNumbers">Section</xref>,
    you will be asked to prove that both the additive and multiplicative identities (i.e, 0 and 1) are unique
    (see <xref ref="thm_unique_additive_identity"></xref>
    and <xref ref="thm_unique_multiplicative_identity"></xref>).
    As another example, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
    (see <xref ref="thm_FTA">Theorem</xref>)
    states that every natural number greater than 1 can be expressed uniquely
    (up to the order in which they appear)
    as the product of one or more primes.
    The typical approach to proving uniqueness is to suppose that there are potentially two objects with the desired property and then show that these objects are actually equal.
    Whether you approach this as a proof by contradiction is a matter of taste.
    It is common to use <m>\tcboxmath{\exists!}</m> as a symbolic abbreviation for
    <q>there exists a unique<ellipsis/> such that</q>.
  </p>

<heuristic xml:id="skeleton_uniqueness">
<title>Direct Proof of <m>(\exists! x)P(x)</m></title>
<statement>
<p>Here is the general structure for a direct proof of the proposition <m>(\exists! x)P(x)</m>. Assume <m>U</m> is the universe of discourse.</p>

<proof>
<p><em>[State any upfront assumptions.]</em> <m>\ldots</m> <m>\ldots</m> <em>[Use definitions, axioms, and previous results to deduce that an <m>x</m> exists for which <m>P(x)</m> is true; or if you have an <m>x</m> that works, just verify that it does.]</em> <m>\ldots</m> Therefore, there exists <m>x\in U</m> such that <m>P(x)</m>. Now, suppose <m>x_1,x_2\in U</m> such that <m>P(x_1)</m> and <m>P(x_2)</m>. <m>\ldots</m> <em>[Prove that <m>x_1=x_2</m>.]</em> <m>\ldots</m> This implies that there exists a unique <m>x</m> such that <m>P(x)</m>.</p>
</proof>
</statement>
</heuristic>

<p>The next theorem provides an opportunity to practice proving uniqueness.</p>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>If <m>c,a,r\in\mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>c\neq 0</m> and <m>r\neq a/c</m>, then there exists a unique <m>x\in\mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>(ax+1)/(cx)=r</m>.</p>
</statement>
</theorem>
